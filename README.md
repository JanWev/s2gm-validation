# s2gm-validation

Project to document and maintain all validation methods for S2GM products

The validation of S2GM products comprises 4 levels from L0 to L3

- L0 - Product integrity
    - Check of completeness
    - Check of integrity of files
- L1 - Product plausibility 
    - Visual inspection of RGB (artefacts, hiatus, expected appearance for mosaicking period)
    - Inspection of spectra
    - Assessment of data range
- L2 - Product verification 
    - Spatial difference for SR for different bands
    - Distribution of SR values for both products
    - Distribution of scene classification
    - Distribution of source_index
- L3 - Product validation
    - Compare number of input products to mosaicking
    - Compare applied algorithm 
    - Compare selected date
